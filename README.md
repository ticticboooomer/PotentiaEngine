# Potentia Engine

The Potentia engine is a DirectX12 based engine focused on being performant and specialized.


## Specialized

The Potentia game engine is by no means a general purpose game engine. 
The engine is designed and built to be used for high performance games with enormous worlds for example:

- Fantasy RPGs, set in **vast open worlds**.
- MMO-RPGs
- Metaverse-Scale Environments

- Basically large requiring low bloat and high quality content.
